# Memorize Game 2.0

A couple of function objects to pay attention to:
- buildCanvasSize -> As the name implies builds the div blocks. It is called once the page is loaded
and once the slide bar's value changes.
- createNumberSystem -> Creates a pairs of random numbers depending on the size of the canvas.
- startGame -> Consists of adding the counters, adding event handlers and the overall mechanism of the game.

Note: Various methods not explained above are pretty much self explanatory in the code.
